## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
df = read.csv("data/EORA-full/20200623_Mother_AllCountries_199_T-Results_2016_090_Markup001.csv")
```

```{r}
head(df)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
